SHORT ANSWERS
    [X] Comment below what the difference between TestNG and the main method is
        // Main Method : 
        	Allows us to run the code within the main method to execute and retrieve the output results based on the given condition and methods being called within the main method. 
        	We are not able to run execute java class without the main method.
        	  
        // TestNG : 
        	TestNG can be used for a testing the class/methods based on expected output; which allows user to test the functionality after the code change to ensure that the code change did not break an existing/previous logic. 
        	TestNG classes are can be executed based on @Test annotations where one can executed all tests using TestNG.
        	Requirement : TestNG plugin in IDE ( I used eclipse )
